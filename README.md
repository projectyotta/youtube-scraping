# youtube-scraping
Get list of vids for channels I sub to , store vid metadata , display filtered results on weekly basis. 

Use case for this was that youtube was pushing too much content on my feed which was not from subscriptions , and the idea was to build something programmatic. 

I should probably productionalize this and use it lol.
